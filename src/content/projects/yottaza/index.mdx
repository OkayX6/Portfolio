Implemented the whole website/PWA, which is an e-commerce platform for construction materials in Cambodia.

The website handles multiple authentication methods very specific to the Cambodian market (**mobile** and **Facebook Login**).

It supports multiple roles and displays different pages depending on them (anonymous, normal user and supplier).
